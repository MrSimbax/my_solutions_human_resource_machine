My solutions for the game "Human Resource Machine".

They beat the size or speed challenges, most of them meet both requirements simultanously, if not, the solutions are split into two files.

The concepts of most solutions are usually simple and most of the challenge comes from optimizing the code by getting rid of unnecessary jumps etc.

The main purpose of this repo is backup, but feel free to read/analyze/use the solutions.
